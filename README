The tar folder contains three source files, which have to
be included into the gromacs-4.5.5 source directory. 
The gromacs-4.5.5 code is available from www.gromacs.org.

The three source files should be copied to the following 
directories of gromacs-4.5.5 :

md.c -> gromacs-4.5.5/src/kernel/
domdec.c -> gromacs-4.5.5/src/mdlib/
domdec.h -> gromacs-4.5.5/include/

We configured the Makefiles using :

./configure --enable-mpi --enable-double --prefix=/path-to-core-md-code/ .

We used a local version of fftw3 and set the local paths using
export LDFLAGS=-L/path-to-fftw3/lib/ and export CPPFLAGS=-I/path-to-fftw3/include/.
We then ran the command make install-mdrun to generate the executable on 
/path-to-core-md-code/bin/mdrun_d .


In the run-example, we use an external input file with a fixed name called
'minput'. The file minput has to exist in the simulation folder, from which 
the simulation gets started. The file 'minput' contains three lines :

1st line, integer : index of the first atom on which the core md algorithm
is applied.
2nd line, integer : index of the last atom on which the core md algorithm
is applied.
3rd line, float   : The value of the energy parameter alpha. A default parameter
should lie in the range from > 0 to 5 kJ/mol. 

The tar folder contains additional folders for the two 
validation cases of TrpCage and dialanine. Each folder contains : an additional 
run-input file (named minput) and an mdp run-input file, the 
topology and the starting structure. 

We executed the code by : mpirun -np NUMBER_OF_CORES /path-to-core-md-code/bin/mdrun_d
-v -s topol.tpr -deffnm trajectory_
